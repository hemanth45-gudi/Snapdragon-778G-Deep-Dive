Project Name : Snapdragon 778G Architecture Analysis & Performance Study

This presentation offers a concise yet technical deep dive into the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G mobile processor, highlighting its architecture and performance optimizations. It details the Kryo 670 CPU cluster, which is based on the ARM Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores. The analysis covers the core's adherence to the ARMv8.2-A Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and its structural design as a Modified Harvard Architecture for improved efficiency. Key topics include the datapath's superscalar design and specialized execution units (like FPU and VPU) , as well as the 14-stage out-of-order execution pipeline of the Cortex-A78. Ultimately, the 778G is presented as a balanced and compelling choice, featuring integrated Snapdragon X53 5G connectivity and the powerful 6th Gen AI Engine.
